## Dev Environment

Please note, I use remote SSH for development work. The terminal runs on a remote server, with the server address 100.75.198.70.

If you access ports on the server via the terminal, you can use localhost directly. However, if you access server ports via an external browser or headless Chrome, you must use the server’s IP address 100.75.198.70.

## Coding Standards

Project-wide engineering conventions (error handling, logging, ORM usage, CSS rules, testing requirements, etc.) are documented in `AGENTS.md`. Treat that document as binding guidance alongside these instructions and review it before making changes to keep new code consistent with the established practices.

## MCP tools

* use `web_search` tool to search the web for up-to-date information
* use `web_fetch` tool to fetch the rendered content of a web page.
